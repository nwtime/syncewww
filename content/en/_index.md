SyncE is an ITU-T standard that facilitates the transference of traceable clock signals over the Ethernet physical layer.

The SyncE Projects provide an ecosystem where organizations and individuals can work together on SyncE tools which are released under an open source license. This collaboration provides great value to those looking at O-RAN solutions.
