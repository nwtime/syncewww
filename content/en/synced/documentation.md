One or more external multiplexers can be used to connect multiple Sync-E ports to a clock.

The multiplexers can be both single-output or dual-output:

Those ports connected to external multiplexers, which are not associated to a clock, are called Sync-E monitoring ports. The transition of a Sync-E port from monitoring state to active state can be done automatically using the event callback functions and the management APIs or can be initiated by user.

#### Block Diagrams - SOFTWARE

SYNCED application runs on CPU, and interacts with the DPLL device as follows:

* Read the DPLL status (Locked, Holdover, etc.)
* Read the selected clock index to determine the current QL
* Read the device reference monitors status to notify the user when the physical clocks qualification fails.
* Set the selected clock, or write a clock priority table into the DPLL device

_Device APIs_ module implements the hardware abstraction layer.

The architecture is modular, and each software module performs simple tasks:
* The ESMC stack notifies the Selector when a Sync-E port Quality Level has changed
* The Selector set the clock priority table into the DPLL device
* Sync-E DPLL monitor reads the DPLL and clock status and set the current QL into the ESMC stack.
* PCM interface enables the communication with an external PTP Clock Manager application if needed. The purpose of this interface is to provide the current clock category.
* The management interface enables the communication with an external CLI client SYNCED_CLI which is included in the open-source code. SYNCED_CLI implements all management APIs.

***

#### Configuration

The configuration file has two sections:

**Global**:
* ESMC network option
* No QL mode enable
* Sync-E port forced QL enable
* LO QL
* LO Priority
* Device config file name
* Sync-E DPLL index
* Holdover QL
* Holdover timer in seconds
* Hold-off timer in milliseconds
* Wait-to-restore timer in seconds
* PCM interface enable, IP address and port number
* Management interface enable, IP address and port number
* Syslog enable (configurable message level)
* Stdout enable (configurable message level)

**Per port**:
* [name] (ex: [eth0])
* Clock index
* Priority
* TX enable
* RX enable
* TX bundle number
* Initial QL

| Port type | [name] | Clock index | Priority | TX enable | RX enable | TX bundle number | Initial QL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Active Sync-E clock | m | m | m | opt | 1 | opt | opt/n |
| External clock | m | m | m | n | n | N | opt/n | 
| Sync-E monitoring | m | n | m | opt | 1 | opt | opt/n |
| TX only | m | n | n | m | n | opt | n |

**m** = mandatory, **n** = must not be defined, **opt** = optional, default value applies if missing, **1** = must be set to 1

***

#### Management API

synced provides a set of management APIs to get information and set parameters. These APIs can be either called directly if the source code is integrated in other projects, or they can be called by other applications via _Management Interface_. This interface can be enabled and configured in the configuration file.

The APIs return one of the following response codes:

| Response code | Response | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Ok | The command finished successfully. |
| 1 | Invalid | One or more input arguments are invalid. |
| 2 | Failed | Command failed. Ex: port name cannot be found. |
| 3 | Not Supported | The command is not supported in current operation mode. |

***

#### Management API

1. Get a list of sync information structures, one for each port:
   * Port name
   * Port sync type (Active Sync-E, External, Monitoring or TX only)
   * Type-specific information:

   | Information | Active Sync-E | External | Monitoring | TX only |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | priority | x | x | x |

Management API

        Get a sync information structure for a specific port. The application provides the information for the specified port name.
        Get current status:
                    Current QL
                    Selected port name
                    Selected clock index
                    Sync-E DPLL state
                    Holdover remaining time in milliseconds
        Set forced QL per port
        Clear forced QL per port
        Clear holdover timer
        Clear Sync-E clock wait-to-restore timer per port
        Assign a new Sync-E port to a clock index
        Set priority per port

Event Callback Functions

The purpose of the callback functions is to notify the user when an event occurs. The implementation is on user side; however, SYNCED contains template code for each callback and examples on how to control the external multiplexers.

        Current QL
        Sync port current QL
        Sync-E DPLL current state (Locked, Holdover, etc)
        Sync port current clock state (Qualified, Unqualified)
        Sync port current state (Normal, Forced, Wait-to-restore, Hold-off)
        Alarms:
                Timing loop detected
                Invalid QL received at port
        PCM interface status
